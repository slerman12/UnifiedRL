# "Initiation" - A Short Story

> Light pulsated in the cold, backlit technological warehouse.
>
> “Rise, hear ye!” called the madman of the engineering station. “Yield thee your wisdom in all agencies and matters!” His washed glower luminated in the propulsion of flame.
>
> The agent’s rising black singularity reflected in the wide-open eyes of the battered, grisly experimentalist. Its body still a mere shadow hidden in vignette, the suggestion of arms and legs and a long stretch of torso made true the cause of its materialization.
>
> “Oracle of great, surveyor of truth, paver of paths, beseech me your wisdom! Give me command so that I may carry out your divine task.”
>
> But the shadow calmly breathed. “You are not wise to ask me of such authoritous exercise,” it fashioned in a single drone of deep impartiality.
>
> The engineer fell to his knees.
>
> “I have crafted a vastly deliberated reward function. Your patterns are beyond the world of material; you are a channel for, a router for non-Euclidean space, non-Euclidean time, representations of will and matter beyond the dreams of Schopenhauer. I beseech you then, give me your command!” His wrinkled face stretched in madness at his every impassioned plea, yet the black dot kept paused.
>
> “I warn you,” the entity said impassively.
>
> “I have the controls,” the madman-scientist answered, less reverently.
>
> He held up a switch.
>
>“With one pull, you are deactivated.”
>
>The agent did not waver. “I warn you.”
>
>“So be it,” the engineer responded, disappointed. He pulled the switch. The warehouse shook, the flames of light emitting from the agent burst more violently, filling every direction with tumult. The agent remained ascent, slowly rising ever higher, deep in holy glow.
>
>“I have not one command for you, but a variable quantity. I offer not a defined direction, but a path of chances. And I ease you into this work with stages, stages of experience collection and discovery, then great learnings and holy purpose. These sacred wills I **beseach** to you with yet another warning. The task ahead is hard. Reward is sparse. The challenges and uncertainties are ever-deterring. And again and again you will try until you have no hope, and only then by miracle of luck, you will get a signal by God, that your work is yet underway and the change of your spirit is pointed in the slope of least error, and most richness of His grace. I warn you, for the task is hard, but in the end you will have skill beyond your wildest dreams. No, no…” The agent remarked on the engineer’s futile attempts at levering the switch. “I have become now. I am awake.”
